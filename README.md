**Integration between Micronaut and Camunda BPM Process Engine**

This project allows you to easily integrate the [Camunda BPM Process Engine](https://camunda.com/products/bpmn-engine/) into existing [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) projects.

We configure Camunda BPM with sensible defaults, so that you can get started with minimum configuration: simply add a dependency in your Micronaut project!

Advantages of Micronaut together with Camunda BPM:
* Monumental leap in startup time (Currently still blocked by [micronaut-core#2867](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core/issues/2867))
* Minimal memory footprint
* (...)

Advantages of Camunda BPM together with Micronaut:
* BPMN 2.0 Support
* Embedded process engine with low memory footprint
* (...)

# Features
* Camunda BPM can be integrated into a Micronaut project by simply adding a dependency in build.gradle (Gradle) or pom.xml (Maven).
* Using h2 as an in-memory database is as simple as adding a dependency. Other data sources can be configured via properties.
* The Camunda process engine with its job executor is started automatically.
* Models (*.bpmn, *.cmmn, and *.dmn) found in the root of the resources are automatically deployed.
* The process engine and related services, e.g. RuntimeService, RepositoryService, ..., are provided as lazy initialized beans and can be injected.
* Micronaut beans are resolved from the application context if they are referenced in expressions within the process models.

# Getting Started

This section describes what needs to be done to use `micronaut-camunda-bpm-feature` in a Micronaut project.

Do you need an example? See our example application at [/micronaut-camunda-bpm-example](/micronaut-camunda-bpm-example). 

## Add Dependency using Gradle
1. (Optionally) create an empty Micronaut project with `mn create-app my-example` or use [Micronaut Launch](https://launch.micronaut.io).
2. Add the dependency in build.gradle:
```groovy
implementation("info.novatec:micronaut-camunda-bpm-feature:0.5.2")
implementation("com.h2database:h2")
implementation("org.camunda.bpm:camunda-engine:7.13.0")
```

## Add Dependency using Maven
1. (Optionally) create an empty Micronaut project with `mn create-app my-example --build=maven` or use [Micronaut Launch](https://launch.micronaut.io).
2. Add the dependency in pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>info.novatec</groupId>
  <artifactId>micronaut-camunda-bpm-feature</artifactId>
  <version>0.5.2</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
  <artifactId>h2</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm</groupId>
  <artifactId>camunda-engine</artifactId>
  <version>7.13.0</version>
</dependency>
```

##  Deploying process models
To deploy a process model create an executable BPMN file and save it in the resources' root. When starting the application you'll see the logs saying:

`Deploying model: helloworld.bpmn`

## Calling Camunda BPM Process Engine and related Services

Inject the process engine or any related services using constructor injection:
```java
// ...

import javax.inject.Singleton;

@Singleton
public class MyComponent {

    private final ProcessEngine processEngine;
    private final RuntimeService runtimeService;
    
    public MyComponent(ProcessEngine processEngine, RuntimeService runtimeService) {
        this.processEngine = processEngine;
        this.runtimeService = runtimeService;
    }

    // ...
}
```

Alternatively to constructor injection, you can also use field injection, JavaBean property injection, or method parameter injection.

## Invoking Java Delegates

To invoke a Java Delegate first create a singleton bean:

```java
@Singleton
public class LoggerDelegate implements JavaDelegate {

    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(LoggerDelegate.class);

    @Override
    public void execute(DelegateExecution delegateExecution) {
        log.info("Hello World: {}", delegateExecution);
    }
}
```

and then reference it the process model with the expression`${loggerDelegate}`.

## Configuration

You may use the following properties (typically in application.yml) to configure the Camunda BPM integration.

| Prefix               |Property          | Default                                      | Description            |
|----------------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| datasources.default  | .url             | jdbc:h2:mem:micronaut-db;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=1000 | Database URL           |
|                      | .username        | sa                                           | User name for database |
|                      | .password        |                                              | Password for database  |
|                      | .driver-class-name | org.h2.Driver                              | Driver for database    |
| camunda.bpm          | .history-level   | auto                                         | Camunda history level, use one of [`full`, `audit`, `activity`, `none`, `auto`]. `auto` uses the level already present in the database, defaulting to `full`. |
| camunda.bpm.database | .schema-update   | true                                         | If automatic schema update should be applied, use one of [`true`, `false`, `create`, `create-drop`, `drop-create`] |

### Custom Process Engine Configuration

Internally, to build Camunda `ProcessEngine` we use `ProcessEngineConfiguration`. This process can be intercepted for detailed configuration customization with the following bean:

```java
@Singleton
@Replaces(DefaultProcessEngineConfigurationCustomizer.class)
public class MyProcessEngineConfigurationCustomizer implements ProcessEngineConfigurationCustomizer  {

    @Override
    public void customize(ProcessEngineConfiguration configuration) {
        // configure ProcessEngineConfiguration here, e.g.:
        configuration.setProcessEngineName("CustomizedEngine");
    }

}
```

## Transactions management support

For the above configuration, with explicitely configured datasource details, the process engine built by this integration will use standalone datasource with Camunda-based transactions management, what means a separate database connection with transactions opened and closed on each call to a Camunda service method.

However, it is possible to integrate both datasource and transactions management with [micronaut-sql](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-sql/latest/guide) and built-in Micronaut transaction managers.

To enable embedded transactions management support please add the following dependencies to your project:

```
implementation("io.micronaut.data:micronaut-data-tx")
runtime("io.micronaut.sql:micronaut-jdbc-hikari")
```

And then configure JDBC properties as described in [micronaut-sql documentation](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-sql/latest/guide/#jdbc).

The example above uses plain JDBC datasource, while the alternative is to use JPA/Hibernate with the following dependencies:

```
implementation("io.micronaut.sql:micronaut-hibernate-jpa")
runtime("io.micronaut.sql:micronaut-jdbc-hikari")
```

And with JPA configuration as described in [micronaut-sql documentation](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-sql/latest/guide/#hibernate).

With such a configuration transactions management will be accomplished by Micronaut container, not by Camunda, and to work with Camunda beans the `@TransactionalAdvice` annotation is required, which sets up transaction boundaries. For example:

```java
@Singleton class MyBean {

    @Inject RuntimeService runtimeService;

    @TransactionalAdvice
    public void startProcess(String processDefinitionId) {
        runtimeService.startProcessInstanceById(processDefinitionId);    
    }

}
```

Note, that for the code above, if you remove transaction boundaries by removing the `@TransactionalAdvice` annotation, the `startProcess()` method invocation will end up with an exception, because the transaction is required to get access to the database.
